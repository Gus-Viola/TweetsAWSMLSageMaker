21 million Americans are unemployed. Trump is delusional to believe these numbers are "amazing," "incredible," "joyous," "stupendous," or any of the other words he has tweeted to describe them. It‚Äôs past time he takes responsibility and provides the relief Americans need.
Trump continues to take all the praise, but none of the blame. The unemployment rate is still staggeringly high at 13.3%.
Too many American families have been shattered by our nation‚Äôs epidemic of gun violence. Democrats will continue fighting alongside students, families, and organizers for sensible gun laws that will keep our communities safe.
No one should be afraid to go on a jog through their neighborhood. No child should be afraid to go to school, no spouse should be afraid to come home, no American should be afraid to go to work or pray in their place of worship. #GunViolenceAwarenessDay
